DenseNets have several compelling advantages: 
1. They alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem.
2. Strengthen feature propagation.
3. Encourage feature reuse.
4. Substantially reduce the number of parameters.

Results:
We did not used any dropout layers or any other regularization techniques at all and without overfitting got a validation accuracy of 0.9 on benchmark CIFAR10 dataset.
